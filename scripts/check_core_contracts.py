"""Static gate: structural contracts of the ``main_logic/core`` package.

The ``LLMSessionManager`` mixin split (#2272) rests on a set of contracts
that comments alone cannot enforce. This check makes every one of them a
CI failure:

CORE_PATCH_ROUTING
    Every facade symbol that any test rebinds via
    ``monkeypatch.setattr("main_logic.core.<attr>", ...)`` (string form) or
    ``monkeypatch.setattr(core_module, "<attr>", ...)`` /
    ``patch.object(core_module, "<attr>", ...)`` (object form) must be read
    by manager/mixin code ONLY through the ``_core_facade`` late-binding
    module object. A module-level from-import of the symbol's REAL binding —
    ``from <owner_module> import <original_name>`` (the module the facade
    re-exports it from) or ``from main_logic.core import <attr>`` (the facade
    itself) — snapshots the value at import time: assertion-style stubs then
    fail loudly, but isolation-style stubs (blocking disk/network IO) go
    silently green while calling the real function. Matching is by SOURCE
    MODULE + original name, so an unrelated ``from vendor import
    get_tts_worker as vw`` (a different object that merely shares the name) is
    NOT flagged. The patched-symbol set is harvested from ``tests/`` by AST
    on every run, so the contract tightens automatically as tests grow. Reads
    through the OWNER module — attribute chains (``import
    main_logic.agent_event_bus`` / ``from main_logic import agent_event_bus
    as bus`` + ``bus.<attr>(...)``) and string getattr (``getattr(bus,
    "<attr>")``) — are rejected the same way. So are facade reads inside
    method defaults/decorators/annotations and class-level constant values:
    those evaluate once at import and freeze the value. Function-local imports
    from the OWNER module (e.g. ``from utils.preferences import ...`` inside a
    method) are a different, deliberate late-binding pattern and stay allowed:
    the facade patch never targeted them, before or after the split.

    The patch-target harvest recognizes both positional and keyword call
    spellings, string (``"main_logic.core.X"``) and object
    (``setattr(core_module, "X", ...)``) forms, and object targets reached
    through a package alias (``import main_logic as ml`` -> ``ml.core``).

CORE_PATCH_TARGET_EXISTS
    Every patched facade attribute must actually exist at the facade top
    level (typo guard), unless the call passes ``raising=False`` or
    ``create=True`` (intentional absent-name guards).

CORE_MIXIN_SHAPE
    A mixin module's top level holds only a docstring, imports and exactly
    one ``*Mixin`` class; the class body holds only a docstring and
    methods, and the class has an empty base list (a base would pull
    inherited behavior into the MRO uncounted). Instance state has a single
    home (``LLMSessionManager.__init__``), and module-level state in a
    mixin would sit outside the facade's rebind semantics entirely. Any
    core module that is neither a mixin, ``manager.py`` nor a registered
    owner submodule is rejected — adding a new owner module is a conscious
    edit to this check.

CORE_MANAGER_SHAPE
    ``manager.py`` holds exactly one class, ``LLMSessionManager``, and its
    top level holds nothing but docstring/imports/that class; the class
    body holds nothing but a docstring, class-level constants and
    ``__init__``. Any other method, nested class or executable statement is
    behavior/state that belongs in a domain mixin.

CORE_MIXIN_DISJOINT
    No method name is defined by two mixin classes (or by both a mixin and
    the manager class). Python would resolve the clash silently by MRO
    order; this makes it a build failure instead.

CORE_MIXIN_BASES
    The base list of ``LLMSessionManager`` is exactly the set of ``*Mixin``
    classes defined in the package — no orphan mixin module, no missing
    base, every base a plain name (dotted/computed bases would make the
    exact-set comparison silently incomplete), and every base bound via a
    package-relative import (``from .focus import FocusMixin``) so a
    same-named class from outside the package cannot take the MRO slot.

CORE_FACADE_LAYOUT
    ``__init__.py`` defines no class at top level, and its last statement
    is ``from .manager import LLMSessionManager`` — the facade namespace
    must be fully populated before the class modules bind it as
    ``_core_facade``.

Every violation prints as ``path:line:col  CODE  message``. Exit 1 on any
violation, 0 otherwise, 2 when the expected layout itself is missing (this
gate hard-fails rather than silently skipping when paths move — see the
agent_server split postmortem).
